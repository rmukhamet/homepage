# Git matters


### The seven rules of a great Git commit message
[source](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line  
For example:

> If applied, this commit will refactor subsystem X for readability
> If applied, this commit will update getting started documentation
> If applied, this commit will remove deprecated methods
> If applied, this commit will release version 1.0.0
> If applied, this commit will merge pull request #123 from user/branch

6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
